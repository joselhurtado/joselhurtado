### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Jose Hurtado "AKA" Visual Brands, I have been a Full-stack designer for the past 19 years, working on staff for Commercial & Advertising Agencies serving the Entertainment, Corporate Divisions, Media fields, and Emerging Hispanic Brands.

### I am currently a UX/UI Senior Design Director at DXagency, During my time as a DXer, Iâ€™ve worked from wireframes, A/B testing, research, prototypes, user flows and journeys, building personas and also visual explorations following User-Centered Design and design thinking methodologies to deliver validated and the best solutions.

### I'm constantly learning new things and challenging my own perspectives to improve my skills in UX/UI Design, Web Design and New Technologies. When I'm not designing, you can find me practicing Mountain Bike or also 3D modeling, AR and coding (JS, React & Python). In 2019 moved to Miami from Los Angeles and most importantly, I'm a husband and father of 2 beautiful little girls.
